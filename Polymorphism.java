//Introduction Polymorphism

/* 

In java, if Orange is a Fruit through inheritance, you can then use Orange in the same contexts as Fruit like this:

String makeJuice(Fruit fruit) {
    return "Apple juice and " + fruit.squeexe();
}

//inside main()

Orange orange = new Orange();

System.out.println(juicer.makeJuice(orange));

Polymorphism, which derives from Greek meaning “many forms”, allows a child class to share the information and behavior of its parent class while also incorporating its own functionality.
